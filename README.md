# challenges
Short and sweet programming challenges, obtained from various places

Each solution should be contained in one file or folder.
This file should have the following template filled in:

```c
// Challenge name: {name}
// Challenge link: {link}
// Completed by Zack Sargent on: {date}
// Notes: {notes}
// Resources: {what I used to solve the problem}
```

## Note:

This is the odds and ends bin for my programming challenges.

Most of my other challenges are either part of my [Project Euler](https://github.com/zsarge/ProjectEuler) repository, or my [Advent of Code](https://github.com/zsarge/AdventOfCode2020) repository.
