# [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

These are my solutions for various [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

I use Project Euler mainly for programming challenges, but it also is nice to practice mathematical thinking.

Every solution gets its own directory, because I plan on varying the languages I use, and this keeps everything uniform.

To Do:

 - create script to modify this readme with links to the solutions
 - Make `addSolution.rb` align all numbers to the thousands place for easy name sorting
